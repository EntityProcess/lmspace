            Given these two queries:
            1. how is CLAUDE.md used in VS Code.
            2. what is the logic for autoapplying copilot instructions
            
            Explain how you would process these queries according to the SubagentInvoker workflow.

        I would process these queries in parallel because they are independent:
        
        1. Parse the two queries from the user input
        2. Call analyzeQueryDependencies() to determine they have no dependencies
        3. Group them into a single execution group since they're independent
        4. Launch both queries in parallel:
           - launchQuery(agentPath, "how is CLAUDE.md used in VS Code")
           - launchQuery(agentPath, "what is the logic for autoapplying copilot instructions")
        5. Poll for both responses concurrently
        6. Return responses in original order (1, 2)
        
        The total execution time would be approximately equal to the slowest query, not the sum of both, demonstrating true parallel execution.
